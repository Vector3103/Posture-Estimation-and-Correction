# Posture-Estimation-and-Correction
**Project Name: Posture Estimation and Correction**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques to estimate and correct posture in various scenarios, including sitting, yoga, and exercises. By leveraging the capabilities of libraries such as MediaPipe, as well as algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Trees, the system aims to provide real-time feedback and guidance to users to improve their posture and prevent potential musculoskeletal issues.

**Features:**
- Real-time posture estimation using MediaPipe pose estimation models.
- Classification of different postures using machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Trees).
- Feedback mechanism to alert users about incorrect posture and provide corrective guidance.
- Customizable for different scenarios such as sitting, yoga, and exercises.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction and visualization of posture data.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- MediaPipe
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Other necessary libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/posture-estimation.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download and install necessary models for MediaPipe pose estimation.
4. Ensure proper setup of the environment (camera access, lighting conditions, etc.).

**Usage:**
1. Run the main script: `python main.py`
2. Select the desired mode (sitting, yoga, exercises).
3. Follow on-screen instructions for posture correction.
4. Receive real-time feedback and guidance based on the detected posture.
